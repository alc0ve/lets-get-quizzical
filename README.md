The entire process building this quiz from scratch was a feat. There were many trial and error moments.

Website that initially showed me how to make a list from answer array.

I had my questions as textContent and was going to write them individually.

This is the website that helped me understand putting things in an array and getting boolean value. Also gave me an idea of setting up my array differently.

I ended up combining questions and answers into a huge array to make it neater than trying to set each question into a function. The answers array didn't look as neat either. Also, I had a difficult time pulling answer using the first format. I may go back and look at previous code to see if I could've made it work.

This is the youtube video that shows how much neater it is to combine questions and answers together in array form.
